// Ex3.2 - People on the Bus
// Number of people in the bus
// There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.
// You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays (or tuples). Each integer array has two
// items which represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get
// off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.
// Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after
// the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still
// in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D
// Take a look on the test cases.
// Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always
// >= 0. So the return integer can't be negative.
// The second value in the first integer array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.

function busStopCalculator(array){
    let passangers = 0;
    array.forEach(element => {
        passangers = passangers-element[1]+element[0];
    });
    return `${passangers} sleeping passangers`;
}

console.log(busStopCalculator([[2,0],[4,1],[8,5],[0,2],[1,0]]));
